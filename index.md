# Hey 👋🏼

I'm Eugie Limpin, a Software Engineer from the Philippines 🇵🇭. Currently, I'm working at
<a href="https://quipper.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quipper</a>
building things for students and teachers to effectively learn online.

This is my internet garage where you can see what I'm currently up to and other stuff.

# Projects

## <a href="https://planner-pearl.vercel.app/" target="_blank">Planner</a>

This project started as a clone of [Ryan Florence](https://twitter.com/ryanflorence)'s
[Planner](https://planner.now.sh) which I committed to building for 15 days
(around an hour per day) as application of Clone Open Source
Applications section of [Swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx)'s excellent book
[The Coding Career Handbook](https://www.learninpublic.org/).

The app is built using the following technologies:

- React
- Javascript & TypeScript
- HTML, CSS & TailwindCSS
- Firebase
  - Firestore
  - Authentication
  - Cloud Functions

# Resources

Good stuff I've found around the web and don't want to forget can be found in
[/resources](/resources).

# Learning

I'm constantly learning (or at least trying!). Here, I keep a list of things
that I'm currently learning and curated resources that I'm using or have
used.

## Now

- [Book] <a href="https://www.learninpublic.org/" target="_blank">The Coding Career Handbook - Shawn Wang</a>
