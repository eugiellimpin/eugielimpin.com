## Projects

### Planner

This project started as a clone of [Ryan Florence](https://twitter.com/ryanflorence)'s
[Planner](https://planner.now.sh) which I committed to building for 15 days
(around an hour per day) as application of Clone Open Source
Applications section of [Swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx)'s excellent book
[The Coding Career Handbook](https://www.learninpublic.org/).

I built it using React, Firebase, and TailwindCSS and based most of the
design from Todoist.

You can find the app <a href="https://planner-pearl.vercel.app/" target="_blank">here</a>.
