# Projects

## <a href="https://planner-pearl.vercel.app/" target="_blank">Planner</a>

This project started as a clone of [Ryan Florence](https://twitter.com/ryanflorence)'s
[Planner](https://planner.now.sh) which I committed to building for 15 days
(around an hour per day) as application of Clone Open Source
Applications section of [Swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx)'s excellent book
[The Coding Career Handbook](https://www.learninpublic.org/).

The app is built using the following technologies:

- React
- Javascript & TypeScript
- HTML, CSS & TailwindCSS
- Firebase
  - Firestore
  - Authentication
  - Cloud Functions

# Learning

I'm constantly learning (or at least trying!). Here I keep a list of things
that I'm currently learning and curated resources that I'm using or have
used.
